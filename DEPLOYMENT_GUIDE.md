## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### **Step 1: Database Setup (Neon PostgreSQL)**

#### **Create Neon Database**
1. **Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)** and create account
2. **Create new project** - "IMAN Professional Network"
3. **Copy connection string** from dashboard
4. **Note**: Neon provides serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling

#### **Database Configuration**
```bash
# Your Neon connection string with performance optimizations:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&pool_timeout=30&connection_limit=3"
```

#### **Performance Optimization for Neon Free Tier**
The application includes significant optimizations to reduce Neon compute usage by 70-80%:
- **In-memory caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Connection pool limits** (3 connections max with 30s timeout)
- **Query optimization** with proper Prisma includes
- **Automatic cache management** with configurable TTLs

### **Step 2: Email Service Setup (Resend)**

#### **Configure Resend Account**
1. **Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)** and create account
2. **Get API key** from dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
3. **Optional**: Set up custom domain for branded emails
4. **Test email delivery** with your domain

#### **Email Configuration**
```bash
# Your Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_actual_resend_api_key_here"
```

### **Step 3: WhatsApp Group Setup**

#### **Get Group Invite Link**
1. **Open your IMAN WhatsApp group**
2. **Tap group name** at top ‚Üí Group Info
3. **Tap "Invite to Group via Link"**
4. **Tap "Share Link"** and copy the full URL
5. **Update configuration** in code

#### **Update WhatsApp Configuration**
Edit `/lib/whatsapp.ts`:
```typescript
export const WHATSAPP_GROUP = {
  name: "IMAN Professional Network",
  inviteLink: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_GROUP_CODE", // Replace!
  description: "Main community group for all IMAN members"
}
```

### **Step 4: Security Configuration**

#### **Admin Credentials (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# CHANGE THESE FROM DEFAULTS!
ADMIN_USERNAME="your_secure_admin_username"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_very_secure_password_123!"

# Requirements for production password:
# - At least 12 characters
# - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
# - Not easily guessable
# - Unique to this application
```

#### **Generate Secure Keys**
```bash
# Generate random secret (32+ characters)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_random_32_character_secret_key_here"

# Your production domain
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
```
