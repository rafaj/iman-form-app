## üö® Critical Architecture Constraints

### Edge Runtime Compatibility (middleware.ts)
- **NEVER import `@/auth` in middleware** - causes 500 MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED errors
- **NEVER import files with `"server-only"` directive** - incompatible with Edge Runtime
- **NEVER import Prisma or database files** - not available in Edge Runtime
- **ONLY use cookie-based authentication checking** - check for session tokens in cookies

### Server-Only Protection (Prisma & Database)
- **ALL Prisma imports MUST have `"server-only"` at top of file** - prevents client-side bundling errors
- **Files with Prisma: `auth.ts`, `lib/auth-adapter.ts`, `lib/database.ts`** - all protected with "server-only"
- **Client components MUST NOT import from `@prisma/client`** - use local enums/types instead
- **Webpack config excludes Prisma from client bundles** - configured in `next.config.ts`

### Performance Optimization (Database)
- **Use in-memory cache (`lib/cache.ts`)** for frequently accessed data
- **Connection pool limits enforced** - maximum 3 connections with 30s timeout
- **Cache TTLs configured** - 1min for auth, 3min for forum, 10min for members
- **Database URL must include pooling parameters** for Neon optimization

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The platform is fully optimized for mobile devices with:
- **Responsive Navigation** - Mobile-friendly menu system
- **Touch-Optimized Controls** - Full-width buttons and proper spacing
- **Adaptive Layouts** - Stack layouts vertically on mobile
- **Shortened Text** - Context-aware text truncation for small screens
- **Directory Filter Buttons** - Stack vertically on mobile to prevent horizontal scrolling

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth integration with major providers
- Magic link email authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin/Member)
- Session management with secure cookies
- Database session strategy with Prisma adapter

### Rate Limiting
- IP-based: 3 requests per 15 minutes
- Email-based: 2 applications per day
- Admin actions: 10 actions per 5 minutes
- Forum actions: 5 edits/3 deletes per 15 minutes

### Data Protection
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention with Prisma
- XSS protection with proper sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging
