# WhatsApp Group Integration Setup

This guide explains how to set up WhatsApp group integration for automatically inviting approved members.

## ðŸ”— Method 1: Group Invite Links (Recommended)

This is the simplest and most reliable method. When someone gets approved, they receive an email with WhatsApp group invite links.

### Step 1: Create WhatsApp Groups

1. **Create your WhatsApp groups**:
   - IMAN Professional Network (Main group)
   - IMAN Tech Professionals (For tech members)
   - IMAN Business Network (For business members)

### Step 2: Generate Invite Links

For each group:

1. **Open the WhatsApp group**
2. **Tap the group name** at the top
3. **Tap "Invite to Group via Link"**
4. **Tap "Share Link"** and copy the link
5. **The link will look like**: `https://chat.whatsapp.com/ABC123XYZ`

### Step 3: Update Configuration

Update the links in `/lib/whatsapp.ts`:

```typescript
export const WHATSAPP_GROUPS = {
  MAIN: {
    name: "IMAN Professional Network",
    inviteLink: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_MAIN_GROUP_CODE",
    description: "Main community group for all IMAN members"
  },
  TECH: {
    name: "IMAN Tech Professionals", 
    inviteLink: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_TECH_GROUP_CODE",
    description: "For software engineers, developers, and tech professionals"
  },
  BUSINESS: {
    name: "IMAN Business Network",
    inviteLink: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_BUSINESS_GROUP_CODE", 
    description: "For entrepreneurs, business owners, and executives"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ¤– Method 2: WhatsApp Business API (Advanced)

For automatic group addition without user action, you can use the WhatsApp Business API:

### Requirements:
- WhatsApp Business API account

## ðŸ“§ How It Works

### Current Implementation (Invite Links):

2. **Sponsor approves** the application
3. **System determines** relevant groups based on professional background:
   - Everyone gets added to Main group
   - Tech keywords â†’ Tech group
   - Business keywords â†’ Business group
4. **Welcome email sent** with personalized group invites
5. **User clicks links** to join groups

### Email Content Includes:
- Welcome message
- Relevant group invites with descriptions

## ðŸŽ¯ Smart Group Assignment

The system automatically determines which groups to invite users to based on their:

- **Professional qualification** text
- **Interest statement** content

### Tech Group Keywords:

### Business Group Keywords:

2. **Keyword matching logic** in `getRelevantGroups()`
3. **Email template** in `sendApprovalNotificationEmail()`
4. **Group assignment rules** based on your community needs

## ðŸ“± User Experience

When approved, users receive a beautiful email with:

1. **Congratulations message**
2. **Personalized group invitations** with green WhatsApp-style buttons
3. **Group descriptions** explaining each community
4. **Next steps** and community guidelines
5. **Professional welcome** with IMAN branding

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

- **Invite links can be revoked** if compromised
- **Group admins control** who can join
- **Links expire** if you set expiration dates
- **No phone numbers exposed** in the application

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Create your WhatsApp groups**
2. **Generate invite links** for each group
3. **Update the configuration** in `lib/whatsapp.ts`
4. **Test with a fake approval** to see the email
