# WhatsApp Group Integration Setup

This guide explains how to set up WhatsApp group integration for automatically inviting approved members to your existing IMAN WhatsApp group.

## ðŸ”— Setup (Simple & Quick)

Since you already have a WhatsApp group, you just need to get the invite link and update the configuration.

### Step 1: Get Your Group Invite Link

1. **Open your existing IMAN WhatsApp group**
2. **Tap the group name** at the top
3. **Tap "Invite to Group via Link"**
4. **Tap "Share Link"** and copy the link
5. **The link will look like**: `https://chat.whatsapp.com/ABC123XYZ`

### Step 2: Update Configuration

Update the invite link in `/lib/whatsapp.ts`:

```typescript
export const WHATSAPP_GROUP = {
  name: "IMAN Professional Network",
  inviteLink: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_GROUP_CODE", // Replace this
  description: "Main community group for all IMAN members"
}
```

**Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GROUP_CODE`** with the code from your actual WhatsApp group invite link.

### Step 3: Test It!

1. **Deploy the changes** to your app
